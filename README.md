# Variables, Constants, and Arrays in Swift

## Variables	
Variables are a way to give a name to a piece of data, so that it can be referenced in your code later on. Variables are made to vary, so that means they can change as the program progresses. 
###Syntax:
var myVariable = 9049876543
var typedVariable: String = “Hello Mars”
Keyword label = data

## Constants
A constant is a way to store data with a name however it will not change throughout the course of a program. 
### Syntax:
let myConstant = 9048689990
let typedVariable: String = “Hello Mars”
Keyword label = data

## Arrays
Arrays are a collection of items. 
### Syntax: 
var friends = [John, Darrell, Blake]
Keyword name = [data0, data1, data2]
